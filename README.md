# A Simple ToDo App w/ Typescript & Fullstack Type Saftey ✅

## Running it locally

1. Make sure you have the latest version of [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev) installed by running `curl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev/installer.sh | sh` in your terminal.
2. Run `wasp db migrate-dev`
3. Run `wasp start`. This will install all dependencies and start the client and server for you :)
4. Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser (your NodeJS server will be running on port `3001`)
